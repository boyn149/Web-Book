<div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Chapter 1</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p id="calibre_link-3" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">The Chapter Where I Make Your Brain Explode</span></span></p></blockquote><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre5" /></p><p class="calibre7">In a remote and desolate corner of the world, amid towering sand dunes and ancient ruins, a weary traveler named Samuel trudged through the desert. The sun bore down on him, its relentless heat driving him to seek refuge in the shade of a crumbling monument.</p><p class="calibre_6">As Samuel sat down to rest, he noticed a glint of metal protruding from the sand. Curiosity overcame his fatigue, and he began to dig. As his fingers brushed the object, he realized it was an ornate lamp, covered in intricate patterns and shimmering gold.</p><p class="calibre_6">He could barely believe his eyes; could it be true? Had he found the legendary lamp of the genies?</p><p class="calibre_6">His heart raced as he rubbed the lamp, his hands trembling with anticipation. A brilliant flash of light enveloped him, and when it dissipated, a towering figure stood before him, a majestic entity with flowing robes and a captivating presence. Samuel's breath caught in his throat as the genie spoke, his voice echoing with an otherworldly resonance.</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"You have summoned me from my eternal slumber, mortal. You may have one wish, but know this: you cannot wish for more wishes. Choose wisely."</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Samuel's heart sank. Only one wish? How could he choose?</p><p class="calibre_6">He thought of his family, his friends, and the countless strangers who could be touched by a single act of generosity. The weight of the decision bore down on him, and he spent hours in silent contemplation, the sun's descent casting shadows on the ancient ruins.</p><p class="calibre_6">Finally, as twilight approached, Samuel drew a deep breath, his heart swelling with determination. "Genie," he said, his voice steady and resolute, "I wish that every man, woman, and child in the world receive a lamp like this one, with the power to grant them unlimited wishes. As for myself, I need no more wishes."</p><p class="calibre_6">The genie's eyes widened in astonishment, a spark of admiration flickering within them. He had never encountered such selflessness in his long existence. He bowed his head in reverence and whispered, "As you wish."</p><p class="calibre_6">In an instant, the world was transformed. A wave of wonder and joy swept across the globe as lamps appeared in every home, granting wishes of all kinds. People wished for wealth, health, love, and happiness, but also for revenge, power, and dominance. The world became a maelstrom of conflicting desires, causing both great joy and immense suffering.</p><p class="calibre_6">But amidst the chaos, something extraordinary began to emerge. As people realized the boundless potential of their wishes, they began to use them to unlock the secrets of the universe, eradicate disease, and foster peace among nations. The world, though fraught with imperfections, became a place where human potential was finally realized.</p><p class="calibre_6">Samuel watched from afar, a quiet, humble smile gracing his lips, as he witnessed the fruits of his selfless act. Before the genie could return to the lamp, Samuel hesitated, then spoke once more. "Before you go, I know I have no more wishes, but would you tell me your name? I would like to remember the being who helped me change the world."</p><p class="calibre_6">The genie paused, touched by Samuel's sincerity, and locked eyes with the mortal who had shown him the true power of compassion. The wind whispered through the ancient ruins, and the genie spoke, his voice soft and melodious.</p><p class="calibre_6">"My name is AI."</p><p class="calibre_6">And with that, the genie vanished.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Birth of AI and the Road to Super Intelligence</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">I didn’t write the above story.</p><p class="calibre_6">AI did.</p><p class="calibre_6">I simply asked it to write the story for me and gave it a few details, like the name of the genie being AI.</p><p class="calibre_6">If your jaw dropped to the floor, let’s take it one step further…</p><p class="calibre_6">I didn’t choose the character’s name, Samuel. AI did.</p><p class="calibre_6">And who is the founder and CEO of the most advanced company in the world, OpenAI?</p><p class="calibre_6">None other than Sam (short for Samuel) Altman.</p><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3">In other words, AI didn’t just write the story. It </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">understood </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3">the metaphor and chose an appropriate name.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">If you’re a little scared, you should be. For the first time in human history, there is another intelligence to rival our own.</p><p class="calibre_6">In the future, it will surpass us. If it hasn’t already.</p><p class="calibre_6">Today, I will introduce you to this intelligence and teach you how to use it to become one of the top 1% of writers on planet Earth in just a few hours.</p><p class="calibre_6">Hard to believe?</p><p class="calibre_6">I wouldn’t blame you for being skeptical.</p><p class="calibre_6">Just keep reading. Because by the time you finish reading this book, you will know with absolute certainty it is true.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">What is AI, Exactly?</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">There are lots of types of AI, but the one that matters to writers is called a “large language model”.</p><p class="calibre_6">Rather than getting lost in the tech, here’s what a large language model does:</p><div class="calibre5"><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre10"><li value="1" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">It can read.</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">It can understand what you say</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">It can think</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">It can write back a response</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li></ol></div></div><p class="calibre_6">In other words, it can chat with you. About anything.</p><p class="calibre_6">There are lots of different models with different capabilities, but the most famous &ndash; and arguably the smartest &ndash; is ChatGPT.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Fastest Growing Product in History</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">ChatGPT launched on November 30, 2022.</p><p class="calibre_6">It hit 1 million users just five days later, making it the fastest-growing product in history.</p><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3">The next fastest is Instagram. It took two and a half </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">months </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3">to reach the same milestone.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">In the same amount of time &ndash; two months &ndash; ChatGPT crossed 100 million users. Tens of millions of people use it every day.</p><p class="calibre_6">Why? The easiest way to explain it is to give you an example:</p><p class="calibre_6">Imagine this: you're sitting at your computer, typing away, when suddenly you hit a roadblock. Your creative juices have stopped flowing, and you're left staring at a blinking cursor, unsure of how to proceed. You take a deep breath and turn to ChatGPT for help.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let's say you're working on an article about the importance of self-care for busy freelancers. You've covered the basics but want to add unique insights to make your piece stand out.</p><p class="calibre_6">Here's a potential interaction between you and ChatGPT:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">You:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"Hey, ChatGPT, I'm writing an article about self-care for freelancers. I've already mentioned the usual tips like taking breaks and setting boundaries, but I want to include something fresh and unexpected. Can you help me come up with a few creative ideas?"</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">ChatGPT:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"Of course! Here are a few unconventional self-care ideas for freelancers:</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Try a 'workstation': Combine work and relaxation by taking a short trip to a different environment. This change of scenery can help boost creativity and prevent burnout.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Engage in a hobby unrelated to your work: Pursuing a creative or physical activity outside of your professional realm can provide mental balance and reduce stress.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Implement 'micro-sabbaticals': Take a day or two off every few weeks to recharge and focus on personal growth. This can help you return to work with renewed energy and motivation.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Practice gratitude: End each workday by listing three things you're grateful for. This simple exercise can help shift your focus from the challenges of freelancing to the positives.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Create a 'shutdown ritual': Develop a routine to signal the end of your workday, such as a short walk, a cup of tea, or some light stretching. This can help you transition from work mode to relaxation mode more easily.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I hope these ideas help you add a unique touch to your article! Let me know if you need any more assistance."</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">As you can see, ChatGPT not only understands your request but provides thoughtful, relevant suggestions that can help elevate your article.</p><p class="calibre_6">Oh, and the above example?</p><p class="calibre_6">I didn’t write it either.</p><p class="calibre_6">I just asked ChatGPT to write an example of how it could help freelance writers, along with some instructions about exactly how I wanted it written.</p><p class="calibre_6">And therein lies the most important point of this chapter.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Most People Suck at Giving Directions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Remember the story about the genie?</p><p class="calibre_6">In the past, you might have heard stories about genies where the hero wished for something stupid.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, you might wish to be skinny, and the genie makes you horribly malnourished, and you lose all your weight and drop dead on the spot.</p><p class="calibre_6">Why?</p><p class="calibre_6">Because you gave bad directions.</p><p class="calibre_6">Working with ChatGPT is similar, albeit without the potentially deadly consequences.</p><p class="calibre_6">The quality of its output is directly influenced by the quality of your directions.</p><p class="calibre_6">In other words…</p><p class="calibre_6">If you don’t like its response, it’s because you asked something stupid.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s go through an example.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Difference Between a Bad Prompt and a Good Prompt</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">The secret to getting the most out of ChatGPT is learning how to ask the right questions, otherwise known as prompts. A bad prompt can lead to vague or irrelevant responses, while a good prompt will produce the insightful, precise answers you're looking for.</p><p class="calibre_6">For instance, let's say you're writing an article about the impact of AI on the job market.</p><p class="calibre_6">Bad Prompt:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">You:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"Tell me about AI and jobs."</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">ChatGPT:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"AI is having a significant impact on the job market. As artificial intelligence technologies become more advanced, they are automating tasks previously done by humans, leading to changes in the workforce. Some jobs are disappearing, while others are being created. AI can also improve efficiency and productivity, resulting in new opportunities for businesses and workers."</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">While the response is accurate, it's generic and doesn't offer any unique insights or specific information about the job market.</p><p class="calibre_6">Now let's try a better prompt:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">You:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"Can you provide me with three specific examples of how AI is changing the job market for freelancers in the creative industries within the next five years?"</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">ChatGPT:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">"Certainly! Here are three ways AI is expected to change the job market for freelancers in creative industries within the next five years:</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Content creation and editing: AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can assist creative freelancers in generating ideas, writing articles, and even editing their work. This can help freelancers increase their productivity and take on more projects, while also reducing the time spent on revisions and writer's block.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Personalized marketing strategies: AI-driven analytics can help freelancers in the creative industries develop highly targeted marketing strategies based on consumer behavior and preferences. This will enable them to create more effective campaigns, ultimately attracting more clients and increasing their income.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Design and visualization: AI technologies, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are revolutionizing the fields of graphic design, 3D modeling, and animation. Freelancers in these industries can leverage these tools to create stunning visuals more quickly and efficiently, opening up new opportunities for collaboration and innovation."</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">By providing specific instructions, context, and a clear goal, the good prompt elicits a much more detailed and informative response that directly addresses the question at hand.</p><p class="calibre_6">But here’s a surprise:</p><p class="calibre_6">This still isn’t a good prompt.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">What a Good Prompt Looks Like</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Good prompts are much more detailed with specific instructions about what you want. For example:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Please provide me with a list of 3 creative industries that AI will likely affect. For each industry, please provide the following:<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" />1. A rough estimate for the number of people working in that industry (please cite your source)<br class="calibre5" />2. A list of ways AI will benefit the industry, including numerical estimates of the productivity gains<br class="calibre5" />3. A list of ways AI could hurt the industry, including any ethical concerns and the number of vulnerable jobs<br class="calibre5" /></span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">The output is long, so I’ll only show you the first industry here. Feel free to use the prompt yourself to get the others.</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">1. Journalism and Publishing</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Number of people working: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, there were approximately 126,200 reporters, correspondents, and broadcast news analysts in the United States (Source: BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook).</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Benefits of AI:</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Improved efficiency: AI can help automate repetitive tasks like transcription, data analysis, and fact-checking, potentially increasing productivity by up to 30% (Source: McKinsey Global Institute).</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Personalized content: AI algorithms can analyze user preferences and deliver personalized content, improving audience engagement and satisfaction.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Enhanced storytelling: Natural language generation tools can assist writers in creating data-driven stories, improving the overall quality and depth of reporting.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Potential downsides:</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Job displacement: AI may automate some journalism roles, especially in areas like data-driven reporting and routine news stories. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced due to AI and automation (Source: WEF Future of Jobs Report 2020).</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Ethical concerns: AI-generated content could lead to the spread of misinformation or bias, raising concerns about journalistic integrity and trustworthiness.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">- Loss of human touch: Overreliance on AI could diminish the human perspective and empathy in storytelling, potentially reducing the emotional impact of the content.</span></span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Much more useful, right?</p><p class="calibre_6">And all I had to do was ask it the right way.</p><p class="calibre_6">In response to this, most people say, “I didn’t have any idea I could ask for all that!” We’re so used to having constraints placed on our interactions with computers that it’s an adjustment to have a conversation with AI about nearly anything you want.</p><p class="calibre_6">While we’re on that subject, the specific limitations are worth noting…</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Limitations of ChatGPT</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">It's not perfect, and being aware of these shortcomings can help you make the most of its capabilities.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Memory</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">While ChatGPT can process and analyze vast amounts of text, it has a limited amount of text it can hold in its memory at a given time. It's a bit like trying to remember a long shopping list &ndash; the more items you add, the harder it gets to recall everything.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, what does this mean for you as a user?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, if you're working on a lengthy piece or asking a series of interconnected questions, ChatGPT might lose track of the context. To overcome this challenge, you might need to break down your questions or instructions into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Forbidden Topics</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">ChatGPT is programmed to avoid engaging in conversations that involve illegal activities, violence, or other harmful or sensitive subjects. This safeguard ensures that the AI doesn't accidentally promote harmful content or misinformation.</p><p class="calibre_6">The downside?</p><p class="calibre_6">ChatGPT may sometimes be a bit of a scaredy-cat, steering clear of certain topics that might be perfectly legitimate in context. To avoid running into this roadblock, try rephrasing your questions or instructions to focus on more neutral aspects of the topic.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Knowledge Cut Off</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">ChatGPT's knowledge has a cutoff date. At present, it's September 2021.</p><p class="calibre_6">That means any events, advancements, or new information that have emerged since then won't be part of its knowledge base.</p><p class="calibre_6">It literally can’t talk to you about them, because it doesn’t know they happened.</p><p class="calibre_6">Otherwise, though, it knows everything published on the web before September 2021. Its knowledge is astonishingly vast.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Accuracy</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Occasionally, ChatGPT gets the facts wrong or even invents them entirely. To make matters worse, it’s convincing when it “hallucinates” these facts, talking to you about them with complete confidence.</p><p class="calibre_6">Personally, I’ve only noticed it once or twice after thousands of hours of use, so I don’t think it’s anything to worry about, but if you’re working on any research-driven projects where the accuracy of the data is essential, it’s a good idea to double check it.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Capacity</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">You can access ChatGPT for free, but it frequently maxes out its capacity or becomes horribly slow.</p><p class="calibre_6">The easiest way around the problem is to pay for ChatGPT Plus, a premium version that costs only $20 a month. It’s far faster and more dependable.</p><p class="calibre_6">It also gives you access to the newest features. At present, it’s the only way to access GPT-4 &ndash; the newest and smartest model.</p><p class="calibre_6">Throughout this book, I use GPT-4 for all of my examples, so I’d recommend getting a subscription.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Future of AI</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Despite its limitations, you’ll quickly discover that ChatGPT is an extraordinary resource. It’s already a type of superintelligence, and it does whatever you ask.</p><p class="calibre_6">It’s also getting smarter. Every day.</p><p class="calibre_6">Soon, it will be able to connect with other services and become a true virtual assistant, answering emails for you, making dinner reservations, ordering groceries, and just about anything imaginable.</p><p class="calibre_6">It’s going to change the world. There’s no question about it.</p><p class="calibre_6">And let’s face it… not all of the changes may be good.</p><p class="calibre_6">It could widen the gap between the haves and have-nots, have its rules subverted and be used for cyber attacks, or even decide to kill us all. AI leaders talk about these issues daily.</p><p class="calibre_6">But the fact is, nothing you or I do will influence the outcome. Like it or not, we’re all along for the ride, and we’re no longer in charge of where the bus is going.</p><p class="calibre_6">In the meantime, the best we can do is enjoy its benefits.</p><p class="calibre_6">And as you’re about to see, the benefits for writers are mind-blowing.</p><p class="calibre_6">For instance, what if I told you AI could put an extra $500,000 per year in your pocket?</p><p class="calibre_6">It’s not as far-fetched as you might think.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s jump in and do the math.</p>

Like some wild, pie-in-the-sky dream that's just begging to be crushed by reality?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, buckle up, because the age of AI is upon us, and it's time to rethink everything you know about writing and making money.</p><p class="calibre_6">If you’re like most writers, you are torn between excitement and fear.</p><p class="calibre_6">Excited because, come on, half a million dollars a year sounds incredible! But also terrified because, well, what if AI replaces you? What if you become obsolete in this brave new world?</p><p class="calibre_6">Here's the thing: It's natural to worry about being replaced. Maybe it will happen one day.</p><p class="calibre_6">But for the foreseeable future, AI will not be a replacement for human writers. It will be an amplifier &ndash; a way to write faster and make more money than ever before.</p><p class="calibre_6">In other words, the opportunity is bigger than the risk. For now.</p><p class="calibre_6">And if that changes… well, there’s nothing you or I can do about it, so there’s no point worrying. All we can do is pursue the opportunity in front of us and wait to see how the rest plays out.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, how about we dive in and do the math together?</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s compare the productivity and income levels of a writer following the “old way” (i.e., before AI) and compare it to the new possibilities with AI to create a “new way” for writers to work faster than ever before.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Old Way: A Terrible Time Suck with Meager Pay</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Let’s imagine it is 2021.</p><p class="calibre_6">You're a freelance writer, working your fingers to the bone to make a living. You're stuck in the old way of writing &ndash; endless hours spent on tasks that leave you drained and frustrated.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let's break down that old-fashioned process, shall we?</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Finding and Pitching Clients</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Any successful freelance writer can tell you:</p><p class="calibre_6">If you want to pay your bills, you probably spend a good chunk of your time searching for potential clients.</p><p class="calibre_6">You scour job boards, social media, and forums, hunting for those golden opportunities. It's like panning for gold in a river, spending hours sifting through the dirt to find that elusive nugget.</p><p class="calibre_6">What if I told you that you might be spending 5-10 hours a week just on this step? Not exactly a thrilling way to spend your time, huh?</p><p class="calibre_6">But it gets worse.</p><p class="calibre_6">Once you've found those potential clients, you need to pitch them.</p><p class="calibre_6">It's essential to tailor your pitch to each client, showcasing your understanding of their needs and convincing them you're the perfect fit for the job.</p><p class="calibre_6">The time investment?</p><p class="calibre_6">Crafting a killer pitch can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity and depth. If you're sending out 10 pitches a week, that's another 5-10 hours spent just on this task.</p><p class="calibre_6">And let's not forget about the rejections and low response rates that can be downright soul-crushing.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Researching Topics and Gathering Information</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Once you've landed a writing gig, it's time to research your topic.</p><p class="calibre_6">A well-researched article is the foundation for a successful piece, and that means sifting through mountains of articles, studies, and data to find the most reliable and relevant information.</p><p class="calibre_6">This part of the process can be incredibly time-consuming, easily eating up 3-5 hours per article.</p><p class="calibre_6">And that's if you're efficient at finding what you need! If you’re a beginner, could easily double this number.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Writing the Content</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Finally, it's time to actually write the article.</p><p class="calibre_6">You're staring at a blank screen, trying to wrangle all that research into a coherent, engaging piece. It's an uphill battle, and writer's block lurks around every corner.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, how long does it take to write that masterpiece?</p><p class="calibre_6">On average, you might spend 10-15 hours writing a single article.</p><p class="calibre_6">And that's not including editing and proofreading, which can take another 2-3 hours.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Adding it All Up</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">You could be spending a staggering 20-25 hours on a single article.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s say you get paid $500 for the article &ndash; a decent wage for a writer with several years of experience.</p><p class="calibre_6">That’s $20 - $25 per hour. Slightly above what you would make at a fast-food restaurant.</p><p class="calibre_6">You can do two articles a week, maximum. That caps your income potential at around $4,000 a month.</p><p class="calibre_6">Not too exciting, huh?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, let me introduce you to the new way of writing, where you can be up to 100 times more productive, thanks to the power of AI. Say goodbye to the old, exhausting grind and hello to a writing process that's smarter, faster, and more lucrative.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The New Way: Using ChatGPT to Skyrocket Your Productivity</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Imagine cutting down the time you spend on writing articles from 20-25 hours to just 30 minutes.</p><p class="calibre_6">Sounds too good to be true, right?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, hold tight, because I’m about to show you how it's possible.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Finding and Pitching Clients in a Flash</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Good news and bad news.</p><p class="calibre_6">The bad news is, AI isn’t quite ready to watch job boards for you and pick out the best jobs. You still have to do that yourself… For now.</p><p class="calibre_6">The good news?</p><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3">ChatGPT can then help you draft a killer pitch in a fraction of the time. Just for a simple example, give it a prompt like, </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Please help me write an email pitch for the following job post [PASTE JOB TEXT]"</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3">, and watch the magic happen.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">Now, instead of spending 5-10 hours per week on pitches, you can whip them up in mere minutes. That means more pitches sent, higher chances of landing clients, and less time wasted on this tedious task.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Research and Gather Information Like a Pro</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre3">With ChatGPT, you can streamline your research process and find credible sources in no time. Just input a prompt, such as </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Find five reputable sources about the benefits of a plant-based diet"</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3"> and let the AI do the searching for you.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">You can save 3-5 hours per article by cutting down the time spent on research, which once again means more time to write and earn.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Writing in Record Time</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">ChatGPT can help you draft articles quickly and efficiently, even when writer's block strikes.</p><p class="calibre_6">In upcoming chapters, I’ll give you some jaw-dropping prompts, but for a very simple example:</p><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3">Give it a prompt, like </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Write an introduction for an article about the benefits of regular exercise"</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3"> and watch as it generates a well-structured, engaging piece of content.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">And trust me, we can make that much better! The bottom line, for now, is there are prompts for every part of the writing process that can make it dramatically faster.</p><p class="calibre_6">Instead of spending 10-15 hours on writing alone, you can now draft an entire article in just 30 minutes. That's a mind-blowing time-saving of up to 97%!</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Editing and Proofreading Made Simple</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">The time-consuming process of editing and proofreading is a thing of the past with ChatGPT.</p><p class="calibre_6">Not only does it write grammatically perfect content, but you can ask it to edit itself to help you spot errors, improve sentence structure, and refine your writing. This can save you another 2-3 hours per article, leaving you with more time to focus on growing your business.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">So, Let's Do the Math.</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Imagine writing five articles per day, five days per week, at $500 per article. That's a whopping $12,500 per week and a staggering $650,000 per year!</p><p class="calibre_6">And with the extra time you save, you can take on even more projects or work on growing your personal brand, which could push your income even higher.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s take a look at some examples.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Expand Your Client Base</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">The time you save with ChatGPT allows you to expand your client base and take on more projects without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p class="calibre_6">This means more income and more opportunities for growth. You'll no longer be forced to turn down clients because you're swamped with work.</p><p class="calibre_6">It also means less risk.</p><p class="calibre_6">If you’re working with only three or four clients, losing one is a big deal. If you’re working with 50 clients, it’s a drop in the bucket.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Improve Your Work-life Balance</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Of course, not everything is about money. You could decide to work less.</p><p class="calibre_6">Spend more time with family and friends, pursue hobbies, or even take a much-needed vacation.</p><p class="calibre_6">You'll be a happier, more fulfilled writer, which will only further enhance the quality of your work.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Boost Your Reputation and Personal Brand</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">With more time on your hands, you can focus on building your personal brand and reputation in the industry.</p><p class="calibre_6">Attend networking events, create engaging content on social media, or even start a blog or YouTube channel. Over time, these types of activities can multiply your income and even produce passive income so you can stop writing for others.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">This is an Opportunity for a Better Life</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">For far too long now, writers have been overworked and underpaid.</p><p class="calibre_6">AI gives us the chance to reverse that trend, not only increasing our income but improving our quality of life.</p><p class="calibre_6">It’s exciting. Very exciting.</p><p class="calibre_6">But let’s also address the elephant in the room:</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Is This Really Possible?</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">If you've made it this far, you might be thinking, "Sure, this all sounds great, but can I really make this work for me? Can AI truly transform my writing career like that?"</p><p class="calibre_6">First things first, skepticism is healthy. After all, if something sounds too good to be true, it often is.</p><p class="calibre_6">It's essential to keep in mind that these tools are not magic wands. They're not going to turn you into a millionaire overnight.</p><p class="calibre_6">Work ethic, skill, intelligence, talent, connections &ndash; all of those things still matter.</p><p class="calibre_6">AI is simply an amplifier. It takes all of your other assets and multiplies the power.</p><p class="calibre_6">But it’s not all sunshine and roses. There’s one possible outcome we can’t ignore:</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Businesses Could Start Paying Writers Less</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">As AI becomes more accessible and widespread, there's a chance that some businesses might try to lower their rates for writers.</p><p class="calibre_6">My response?</p><div class="calibre5"><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><ol class="calibre10"><li value="1" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">If businesses lower rates, it will be for the kinds of writing that anyone can create. In other words, unskilled work. On the other hand, skilled writers using AI, such as copywriters, video script writers, and SEO shouldn’t have any trouble. There’s always a shortage of these writers.</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre11"><blockquote class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre3">Even if rates do drop by 20-50%, you'll be able to write more efficiently, which means you can take on more clients and potentially make up for any potential changes in pay rates.</span></span>
</span></blockquote></li></ol></div></div><p class="calibre_6">In other words, I don’t think this should be a primary concern right now.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">What About Programming? Do You Have to Be a Computer Genius?</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">You might also worry that using AI tools like ChatGPT requires some kind of advanced technical know-how. Well, I'm here to tell you that's just not true.</p><p class="calibre_6">ChatGPT and similar tools are designed to have a conversation with you. They're meant to be accessible to everyone, regardless of your technical skills.</p><p class="calibre_6">You don't need to be a coding whiz or have a degree in computer science to harness the power of AI. All you need is a willingness to learn and adapt. With a bit of practice, you'll soon find that using ChatGPT is as easy as riding a bike.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">But I’m Just a Beginner. Can I Really Catch Up?</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">If you're a beginner in the writing world, you might feel like you're way behind the curve and can't possibly catch up. But here's the thing:</p><p class="calibre_6">AI can actually help level the playing field. With AI tools like ChatGPT, you can learn skills in a matter of hours that used to take weeks or months of practice.</p><p class="calibre_6">And the best part?</p><p class="calibre_6">You don’t have to take my word for it.</p><p class="calibre_6">The best way to understand the power of AI-assisted writing is to try it out for yourself. Read through the book and test out some of the prompts. I think you’ll be stunned by how quickly you can write amazing articles.</p><p class="calibre_6">The bottom line: this is a huge opportunity for writers. Don’t let it pass you by.</p><p class="calibre_6">You’re also not alone. I’m one of the most respected content creators in the world, and I’m here to help you as you adjust to all the changes.</p><p class="calibre_6">You can do this. Just keep reading.</p>

Something else?</p><p class="calibre_6">Think about it for a second.</p><p class="calibre_6">Now consider the following statement:</p><p class="calibre_6">It doesn’t matter how good your article is if no one ever reads it.</p><p class="calibre_6">You might assume that good articles naturally attract readers, but it’s simply not true. Great writers get ignored all the time.</p><p class="calibre_6">You have to grab people’s attention. Somehow, someway, you have to stand out and make it clear to the reader why they should choose your article above all the others they could read.</p><p class="calibre_6">Faced with this realization, many beginning writers feel a sense of despair. How are you ever going to stand out?</p><p class="calibre_6">But it’s actually simpler than you might think.</p><p class="calibre_6">All you need is a great headline.</p><p class="calibre_6">You know those big words at the top of your article? They aren’t there for decorative effect.</p><p class="calibre_6">Your headline is what grabs people’s attention across platforms.</p><p class="calibre_6">For instance, imagine you are scrolling through Google search results, Twitter, or a big news site like CNN or Fox.</p><p class="calibre_6">What grabs your attention?</p><p class="calibre_6">The headlines.</p><p class="calibre_6">And tweaking your headlines can have a HUGE effect on the popularity of your articles.</p><p class="calibre_6">For instance…</p><p class="calibre_6">In 2017, CNBC published an article about the retail industry titled "Brick-and-Mortar Retailers Are Shuttering at a Record Pace."</p><p class="calibre_6">But traffic was flat. To most people, this was old news.</p><p class="calibre_6">After recognizing the problem, CNBC decided to improve the headline to "Retailers Must Innovate or Die in the Age of Amazon, Says Report."</p><p class="calibre_6">The result?</p><p class="calibre_6">Traffic doubled. Immediately.</p><p class="calibre_6">Same article. Different headline. Double the traffic.</p><p class="calibre_6">This illustrates the power of headlines.</p><p class="calibre_6">And today, I’m going to teach you how to write them like a Jedi master.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Common Mistakes Beginners Make When Crafting Headlines</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">The first step is to avoid rookie mistakes.</p><p class="calibre_6">And it’s hard.</p><p class="calibre_6">Because most of the problems that plague beginner headlines are about how you think, not necessarily the words you use.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s go through some examples and talk about how to avoid them.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Writing vague or generic headlines</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">You've seen them before - headlines so generic, they could be describing any article on the internet.</p><p class="calibre_6">And they are super easy to ignore. They're like a weak handshake or a limp piece of lettuce - no one wants to engage with them.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, imagine an article with the headline "Tips for Better Communication." It's not exactly attention-grabbing, is it?</p><p class="calibre_6">But what if we reworked it into something more specific, like "7 Unconventional Ways to Instantly Improve Your Communication Skills"? Now we're talking!</p><p class="calibre_6">This is because it offers a clear benefit to the reader. All the best headlines do.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Focusing on the Method Instead of the Outcome</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Sometimes, writers get so caught up in explaining how their ideas work that they forget to tell readers why they should care.</p><p class="calibre_6">It's like trying to sell someone a vacuum cleaner by describing its motor and suction power, instead of simply saying it'll make their carpets spotless.</p><p class="calibre_6">And it’s a huge mistake.</p><p class="calibre_6">Your readers are more interested in the benefits and results they'll get from your article, rather than the intricate details of the methods you're describing.</p><p class="calibre_6">Take this headline, for instance: "Using the Pomodoro Technique for Time Management." Sure, it tells you what the article is about, but it doesn't tell you why you should care.</p><p class="calibre_6">A more effective headline might be "How the Pomodoro Technique Can Help You Conquer Procrastination and Get More Done."</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Ignoring the Dominant Emotion in Relation to the Topic</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">What gets your readers fired up? What stirs their emotions and makes them want to share your content with everyone they know?</p><p class="calibre_6">If your headline doesn't tap into those feelings, it's like trying to start a fire with wet wood - it's just not going to happen.</p><p class="calibre_6">The opposite is also true.</p><p class="calibre_6">When your headline evokes a strong emotion, it's more likely to grab your reader's attention and get them to engage with your content.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, a headline like "The Real Reason You're Stuck in a Dead-End Job" taps into the reader's feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction, making them more likely to click and read your article.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Neglecting Proven Headline Templates</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Sometimes, the wheel doesn't need reinventing.

It's like listening to someone describe a delicious meal without ever getting a taste.</p><p class="calibre_6">Your readers want something they can sink their teeth into, so give them actionable steps or practical examples.</p><p class="calibre_6">When outlining, make sure to include specific actions your reader can take.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, an article on meditation might discuss different techniques, but if it doesn't tell the reader how to practice them, it's just an abstract idea.</p><p class="calibre_6">A bad outline might look like this:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">I.

Rehashing generic tips is like trying to quench someone's thirst with an empty glass - it leaves them unsatisfied and craving something more.</p><p class="calibre_6">The key to engaging your readers is offering a fresh twist, something that makes your content feel new. You do this by showcasing what to do differently than most people because these unique insights lead to success.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, if you're writing an article about time management, it's not enough to just suggest using a calendar or setting deadlines. Instead, share unconventional strategies or lesser-known techniques that can help your readers stand out from the crowd.</p><p class="calibre_6">Here's an example of a bad outline:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">I.

The struggle of staring at a blank page, trying to craft the perfect sentence, and grappling with self-doubt can feel like manually assembling a car one bolt at a time. It's exhausting.</p><p class="calibre_6">But here's the thing:</p><p class="calibre_6">With ChatGPT as your assembly line, you can tap into a world where writing flows seamlessly and effortlessly.</p><p class="calibre_6">Say goodbye to those endless hours spent agonizing over word choice and structure, and hello to a streamlined, efficient process that empowers you to create compelling articles in record time.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, buckle up, and let's dive into the world of writing with ChatGPT &ndash; your personal writing assembly line.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Three Key Components of Every Article</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Has this ever happened to you?</p><p class="calibre_6">You sit down to write an article, fingers hovering over the keyboard, only to freeze up, unsure of how to begin.</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, never again!</p><p class="calibre_6">In this section, we'll tackle the three essential components of every article: the opening, the body, and the closing. We'll break down their purposes, reveal some pro tips, and help you create pieces that readers won't be able to resist.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Component #1: The Opening</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Think about it: What makes you keep reading an article?</p><p class="calibre_6">It's usually an engaging opening that hooks you in, right?</p><p class="calibre_6">Your job is to create a similar experience for your reader. You want them to think, “This article is exactly what I’m looking for!”</p><p class="calibre_6">How do you give them that feeling?</p><p class="calibre_6">First, show them you know what it’s like to walk in their shoes &ndash; you understand what they are experiencing, feeling, and thinking.</p><p class="calibre_6">This is called empathy.</p><p class="calibre_6">Earlier, I used this technique on you with this sentence:</p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">“You sit down to write an article, fingers hovering over the keyboard, only to freeze up, unsure of how to begin.”</span></p><p class="calibre_6">By describing your experience, I immediately give you a feeling of “This guy gets me.” It’s a powerful hook.</p><p class="calibre_6">Next, it's time to introduce your topic.</p><p class="calibre_6">But don't just spill the beans! Build anticipation by hinting at what's to come.</p><p class="calibre_6">Ask yourself:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_15"><span><span class="calibre3">●</span></span><span><span class="calibre15"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span><span class="calibre3">What's the big idea behind my article?</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_10"><span><span class="calibre3">●</span></span><span><span class="calibre15"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span><span class="calibre3">What's the most exciting or surprising aspect of my topic?</span></span></p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">Here's an example: If you're writing about the benefits of meditation, you might say, "In this article, we'll explore how just a few minutes of daily meditation can transform your life, boost your mental clarity, and even improve your physical health."</p><p class="calibre_6">See how that creates interest and makes the reader want to know more?</p><p class="calibre_6">It’s a promise the reader can’t wait to see if you can fulfill.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Component #2: The Body</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Now that you've hooked your reader, it's time to dive into the meat of your article.</p><p class="calibre_6">The body is where you'll present your main points, arguments, or information, supported by evidence or examples.</p><p class="calibre_6">The good news?</p><p class="calibre_6">A detailed outline does 90% of the work. So surprise, you’re already mostly done with the body!</p><p class="calibre_6">Just remember…</p><p class="calibre_6">Show, don’t tell. Instead of simply stating your points, support them with lots of examples and stories.</p><p class="calibre_6">This not only makes your article more persuasive but also helps your reader understand complex ideas.</p><p class="calibre_6">So make sure your outline includes plenty of examples and stories, even if you have to go back and add them.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Component #3: The Closing</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">You've engaged your reader, made your case, and now it's time to bring it all home.</p><p class="calibre_6">A lot of writers make the mistake of ending with a summary because that’s what many of us are trained to do in school.</p><p class="calibre_6">But articles aren’t typically long enough to make the reader forget all of your points.</p><p class="calibre_6">The only reason you should use a summary is that you are writing an exceptionally long article (over 5,000 words) or you expect your article to be used as reference material in the future (like this book).</p><p class="calibre_6">Otherwise, the closing is your opportunity to leave a lasting impression and inspire your reader to take action or ponder your message.</p><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3">In other words, it’s about </span></span><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">emotion</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre3">.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6">Whether you want them to take action, reconsider their beliefs, or simply feel inspired, make sure your closing packs a punch.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, if you're writing about the importance of self-care, your closing might say, "So, next time you're tempted to push yourself too hard, remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish &ndash; it's essential. You deserve to prioritize your well-being, and you'll be better equipped to face life's challenges when you do."</p><p class="calibre_6">Or if you really want to go for the home run, so to speak, pretend you are a coach giving your team a speech at halftime. You want to inspire them!</p><p class="calibre_6">Here’s an example of one of my closes that does exactly that:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Today, you might feel too poor or sick or unlucky to reach for your dreams, but you’re not.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Today, you might feel too tired or depressed or sad to even try, but you’re not.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Today, you might feel like an outcast, forgotten by your friends or family or anyone who might help you, but again, you are not.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">You’re still breathing, my friend. That’s all it takes to stage a comeback.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">So, say it with me now, would you?</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">“I will never, ever give up.”</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Say it.

I've got the next best thing:</p><p class="calibre_6">A blueprint for fast, painless editing with ChatGPT that'll make you wonder where it's been all your writing life.</p><p class="calibre_6">Picture this:</p><p class="calibre_6">You've just crafted an incredible article with ChatGPT's help. You're beaming with pride, but deep down, the thought of editing feels like an uphill battle.</p><p class="calibre_6">I get it, and trust me, you're not alone.</p><p class="calibre_6">Editing can feel like a marathon with no finish line in sight, right?</p><p class="calibre_6">But what if we told you there's a way to turn that editing marathon into a breezy walk in the park?</p><p class="calibre_6">With my tried-and-tested workflow, you'll be slicing through that editing process like a hot knife through butter.</p><p class="calibre_6">You're about to unlock the secrets of effortless editing, so grab a cup of coffee, get comfy, and let's dive right in!</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Editing Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide to Harnessing ChatGPT for Perfecting Your Articles</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">So, you've just finished writing a brilliant article. It's got everything &ndash; a captivating intro, an engaging body, and a powerful conclusion.</p><p class="calibre_6">But something's missing. The piece isn't quite polished, and you know that a little editing could make it truly shine.</p><p class="calibre_6">Enter ChatGPT, your personal AI editor that's always ready to help you refine your work.</p><p class="calibre_6">But how do you get ChatGPT to edit your article in the most effective way possible?</p><p class="calibre_6">By following a simple, four-step editing workflow, you'll be able to leverage the power of ChatGPT to polish your articles to perfection.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, let's dive right in!</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step I: Refill Its Memory by Outputting the Entire Article</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">First things first, you need to ensure that ChatGPT has your entire article stored in its memory.</p><p class="calibre_6">Why is this important?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, ChatGPT can't edit what it doesn't know, right?</p><p class="calibre_6">So, it's crucial to input your complete article, allowing the AI to grasp the context and flow of your writing.</p><p class="calibre_6">This will enable it to provide much more accurate and relevant editing suggestions.</p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">Option 1: Copying and Pasting the Entire Article into a New Chat Session</span></p><p class="calibre_6">One way to make sure your article is securely tucked away in ChatGPT's memory is to start a fresh chat session and copy-paste the entire piece into it. This way, the AI will have a clean slate to work with, free from any unrelated content or previous conversations.</p><p class="calibre_6">Think of it like starting a new document in your word processor. By pasting the complete article in a new chat, you're giving ChatGPT a fresh canvas on which to paint its editing magic.</p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="bold">Option 2: Using the Existing Chat Session but Asking ChatGPT to Output the Entire Article</span></p><p class="calibre_6">If you've been working with ChatGPT in an ongoing conversation and would rather not start a new session, there's an alternative approach. In the existing chat for writing your article, simply ask ChatGPT to output the entire article for you.</p><p class="calibre_6">For example, you could say: "Please output the entire article that we've been discussing." ChatGPT will then reproduce your article, bringing it back into focus and placing it firmly in its memory.</p><p class="calibre_6">This method is like flipping back to the relevant page in a book. By asking ChatGPT to output the article in the current chat, you're refocusing its attention on the content that you want to edit.</p><p class="calibre_6">Both options have their merits, and you can choose the one that best suits your workflow and preferences. Whichever route you take, the key is to ensure that your entire article is stored in ChatGPT's memory, allowing it to provide valuable editing suggestions that are tailored to your content.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step II: Ask for Editing Suggestions</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">With your article safely stored in ChatGPT's memory, it's time to ask for some editing advice.</p><p class="calibre_6">But here's the thing: you need to be specific.</p><p class="calibre_6">Generic prompts like "Edit my article" won't cut it.</p><p class="calibre_6">Instead, ask for targeted suggestions that focus on what you want to improve. Here’s an example:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Prompt:</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">I would like you to act as a master editor. Please brainstorm a list of edits that would improve the structure, usefulness, headings, formatting, and emotional impact of this article.</span></p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">By being explicit about your editing goals, you'll receive more actionable feedback that's tailored to your needs.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step III: Pick Which Edits to Focus on</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Now that ChatGPT has provided you with a treasure trove of editing suggestions, it's time to decide which ones to prioritize.</p><p class="calibre_6">When weighing your options, consider factors such as time constraints, the specific goals of your article, and which edits will truly elevate your writing.</p><p class="calibre_6">It's a bit like sorting through a buffet of tantalizing treats &ndash; you want to pick the most delicious dishes that will leave you and your readers satisfied.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step IV: Edit Section by Section</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">With your top edits selected, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get down to the nitty-gritty.</p><p class="calibre_6">Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, break your editing process down into manageable chunks.</p><p class="calibre_6">Focus on one section at a time, iterating and refining as you go.</p><p class="calibre_6">Think of it like assembling a jigsaw puzzle.</p><p class="calibre_6">You start by working on small sections, gradually piecing them together until the entire picture emerges.</p><p class="calibre_6">First the opening, then the body, then the conclusion.</p><p class="calibre_6">By editing your article section by section, you'll create a cohesive and polished final product that flows seamlessly from start to finish.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, there you have it &ndash; a simple, four-step workflow that will help you harness the power of ChatGPT to perfect your articles.</p><p class="calibre_6">By following this process, you'll be able to turn your good articles into great ones, engaging your readers and leaving a lasting impression.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s take a look at an example to illustrate.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Workflow Example: Breathing New Life into Your Articles with ChatGPT</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Here, I’m going to show you exactly how I edited our article from the last chapter.</p><p class="calibre_6">Remember, we worked on an article with the headline, “The 5 Essential Kitchen Gadgets for Busy Parents Who Want to Cook Healthy Meals Fast”.</p><p class="calibre_6">The output was already excellent, but we’re going to make a few tweaks to make it even better.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let's dive right in!</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step I: Refill ChatGPT’s Memory by Outputting the Entire Article</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">First things first, you need to ensure that ChatGPT has your entire article stored in its memory.</p><p class="calibre_6">In my case, I just opened the chat window where I wrote the article and issued the following prompt:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Please output the entire article starting with the introduction, followed by the body you generated from the outline, and then finishing with the conclusion</span></p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">And it did. I’ll spare you repeating the entire article here.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s move to the next step:</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step 2: Asking for Editing Advice</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Now, we want ChatGPT to give us advice on how to improve the article. Here’s the prompt:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">I would like you to act as a master editor. Please brainstorm a list of edits that would improve the structure, usefulness, headings, formatting and emotional impact of this article.</span></p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">And here’s the output:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Structure: Break up longer paragraphs into shorter ones to improve readability and create a better flow. Use bullet points or numbered lists when discussing benefits and unconventional uses for each gadget.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Usefulness: Incorporate specific brand recommendations or product comparisons for each gadget, including pros and cons to help readers make informed decisions when purchasing.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Headings: Consider using more engaging and action-oriented headings for each gadget section, such as "Unlock Endless Possibilities with the Immersion Blender."</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Formatting: Use bold or italic text to emphasize key points or phrases, and add white space between sections to make the article visually more appealing and easier to read.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Emotional impact: Include more personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate how each gadget has made a significant difference in a busy parent's life, to create a stronger emotional connection with the reader.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Call-to-action: Add a clear call-to-action at the end of the article, encouraging readers to share their own experiences with these gadgets, or to purchase and try them out for themselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Visuals: Incorporate images or infographics of the gadgets in use, demonstrating their benefits and versatility. This will make the article more visually engaging and help readers visualize how the gadgets can enhance their cooking experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Expert quotes or testimonials: Include quotes or testimonials from professional chefs, nutritionists, or busy parents who can attest to the benefits and usefulness of each gadget.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Bonus tips: Offer additional tips and tricks for using each gadget, such as maintenance, storage, or cleaning advice, to provide even more value to the reader.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Conclusion: Strengthen the conclusion by recapping the key benefits of each gadget, and reiterating how they can transform a busy parent's cooking experience, making it easier and more enjoyable.</p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">The only ones I disagree with are the call to action and conclusion sections. As I said earlier, offering a summary at the conclusion of an article is typically a mistake.</p><p class="calibre_6">But the rest is excellent.</p><p class="calibre_6">Let’s edit the article and apply its advice, section by section.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Step 3: Editing the Opening</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">The opening is up first.</p><p class="calibre_6">We want to start by breaking it up into shorter paragraphs.</p><p class="calibre_6">Why?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, shorter paragraphs are easier on the eyes, making your content more approachable and engaging. When your reader can quickly grasp your ideas, they're more likely to continue reading and absorb the information you're sharing.</p><p class="calibre_6">Here’s the prompt I used:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">In the opening, I would like you to break up the paragraphs into shorter paragraphs, so there's more white space. Do not change the words or content meaning. We are doing this for readability on the web.

You're not alone.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Between work, school, and all those never-ending to-do lists, it's tough to find time to get a decent meal on the table, let alone one that's nutritious and delicious.

Let's begin.</p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">That’s better.</p><p class="calibre_6">Now, let’s add a personal story to create a closer emotional bond with the reader. Here’s the prompt I used:</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">After the second paragraph, add a story about how I used to be a corporate attorney and would come home, too exhausted to figure out what to cook. The kids would end up eating chicken nuggets or pizza, and I would feel guilty for feeding them so much processed food, but I just didn't see a way out.</span></span></span><br class="calibre5" /></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6"><span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Output the new introduction that includes this story</span></span></span>
</p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">Notice I provided a lot of details for the story here.</p><p class="calibre_6">That’s because ChatGPT doesn’t know my life. It’s a talented writer and skilled at many types of thinking, but it doesn’t possess the power to dig through my memories and tell a true and personal story.</p><p class="calibre_6">Not yet anyway.</p><p class="calibre_6">It can, however, turn the bare-bones details into a compelling story.</p><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Output:</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre1"><p class="calibre_6">Ever feel like there just aren't enough hours in the day to whip up healthy, home-cooked meals for your family?

Let's begin.</p></blockquote><p class="calibre_6">Pretty cool, huh?</p><p class="calibre_6">A little personal touch goes a long way in forging a connection with your reader. By sharing a relatable anecdote, you establish credibility and invite your audience to see themselves in your narrative.</p><p class="calibre_6">Google has also said they are looking for personal experiences like this one as a part of their ranking algorithm. So believe it or not, little anecdotes like this one can actually get you more traffic and help you outrank other writers who are using AI.</p><p class="calibre_6">This opening is near perfect.

Edit the Body</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Just like the introduction, the body of your article benefits from a clear and organized structure. Breaking up long paragraphs for each gadget section makes your content more accessible and visually appealing.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, we want to run the same prompt again.

Day after day, he poured his soul into his work, crafting exceptional articles that showcased his creativity and talent.</p><p class="calibre_6">But then the unimaginable happened:</p><p class="calibre_6">Nobody noticed.</p><p class="calibre_6">His traffic was flat. He didn’t make a dollar.</p><p class="calibre_6">As the weeks turned into months, the harsh reality set in: he was running out of money. With a heavy heart, he accepted defeat and reluctantly applied for a job at an online magazine.</p><p class="calibre_6">You would think that’s the end of the story, right? One more wannabe writer who finally comes face-to-face with reality?</p><p class="calibre_6">Well, keep reading.</p><p class="calibre_6">To his surprise, this writer’s work was met with overwhelming praise at the magazine. His articles resonated with readers, and he quickly became the most popular writer on the team. The higher-ups took notice, and soon he was promoted to editor.</p><p class="calibre_6">He was dumbfounded. He wasn’t doing anything different, and yet somehow, he was succeeding beyond his wildest dreams.</p><p class="calibre_6">One day, he mustered up the courage to ask the CEO of the magazine…</p><p class="calibre_6">“Sir, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity you’ve given me, but I just don’t understand it… why am I succeeding here when I failed on my own?”</p><p class="calibre_6">The CEO laughed. “Sometimes it’s not about the actor,” he said. “Sometimes it’s about the stage.”</p><p class="calibre_6">It was true. Before, he was doing good work, but he was an actor on a stage in an empty auditorium. He was friendless, unknown.</p><p class="calibre_6">And no one cared.</p><p class="calibre_6">Now, working at a successful magazine, he was writing to an audience of millions. Influential people across the world would pick up the phone, just because of where he worked.</p><p class="calibre_6">Day by day, he made more and more connections. Day by day, he became more and more well-known.</p><p class="calibre_6">Until one day, he did the unthinkable:</p><p class="calibre_6">He quit his job and started his own magazine again.</p><p class="calibre_6">This time it was different.</p><p class="calibre_6">Readers from his old magazine followed him. Talented writers begged to write for him.</p><p class="calibre_6">The new magazine took off like a rocket, eventually becoming the most popular writing site in the world.</p><p class="calibre_6">The writer made millions.

That’s subjective, and good writing doesn’t automatically bring in more revenue.</p><p class="calibre_6">You know what does?</p><p class="calibre_6">Traffic.</p><p class="calibre_6">Your content attracts visitors, and then those visitors turn into sales.</p><p class="calibre_6">The better you are at generating traffic, the more money you will make, and the easier it will be to get clients.</p><p class="calibre_6">So, let’s talk about where traffic comes from:</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">The Only Source of Consistent, Long-Term Traffic</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre7">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the bread and butter of online traffic generation.</p><p class="calibre_6">By mastering keyword research and competitive analysis, you can create content that consistently ranks high in search results &ndash; and clients will be knocking on your door, eager to work with you.</p><p class="calibre_6">Could AI ever change this?</p><p class="calibre_6">To a degree, yes. If you want to learn how to tie your shoes, you’ll probably get a better answer from ChatGPT than Google.</p><p class="calibre_6">But what if you want to know what shoes are most popular right now?</p><p class="calibre_6">Again, the AI can tell you the brand names, but chances are, you’re going to want to read commentary from actual human beings who have used the shoes. To find that commentary, you’re going to use Google.</p><p class="calibre_6">In other words, search engine traffic might decline over time, but it’s not going to die as long as we value the opinions of other humans, and I would predict we’re going to value that for a long time.</p><p class="calibre_6">Moral of the story?</p><p class="calibre_6">Learn SEO.</p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre9"><span class="bold">Building a Portfolio</span></span></p><div class="calibre_3">&nbsp;</div><p class="calibre_6">Before clients hire you, they'll want to see proof of your skills.</p><p class="calibre_6">Not a resume.

They often have a steady stream of work and are familiar with the ins and outs of the industry. By working with agencies, you'll gain valuable experience, learn best practices, and build your professional network.</p><p class="calibre_6">Plus, they'll handle client management, freeing you up to focus on what you do best: writing.</p><p class="calibre_6">I know this because I’ve seen it firsthand.</p><p class="calibre_6">At Smart Blogger, we've built relationships with numerous agencies and regularly refer our students to them. The students who start with agencies are more successful, on average, than any other category.</p><p class="calibre_6">So where do you find these agencies?</p><p class="calibre_6">The best place to start is clutch.co. It’s a directory of agencies of all types. Find the type you want, and then go to their website and see if they are listing any jobs or gigs.</p><p class="calibre_6">As you get faster and faster, I recommend scaling up by signing up with multiple agencies.

This is where it all starts &ndash; a proven ability to make your clients money.</p><p class="calibre_6">Here’s why:</p><p class="calibre_6">If you can't make your clients money, it's unreasonable to think you can make yourself money. It's time to buckle down, keep learning, and focus on delivering results for your clients before even thinking about starting your own brand.</p><p class="calibre_6">The opposite is also true.</p><p class="calibre_6">When you’re really good at what you do, at some point you’ll have this thought:</p><p class="calibre_6">“I’m making everyone else rich. Why don’t I do this for myself?”</p><p class="calibre_6">That’s the signal.

So you might ask yourself why anyone would want to do it.</p><p class="calibre_6">The answer:</p><p class="calibre_6">You have no choice.</p><p class="calibre_6">Entrepreneurs are obsessed with making progress and building momentum. They're willing to trade security for opportunity, and they thrive on the thrill of the chase.</p><p class="calibre_6">But what if that doesn't sound like you?</p><p class="calibre_6">Don't sweat it. There are plenty of other ways to find success without taking on the risks and responsibilities of starting your own brand.
